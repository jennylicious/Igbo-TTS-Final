# Reflection – Igbo TTS App Project

## What Worked
- Successfully connected to the ElevenLabs API using Gradio
- Generated high-quality speech in Igbo using the Eze voice
- Allowed users to type text, choose a voice, and play/download speech audio
- Tuned pronunciation using punctuation and spacing

## What Was Tricky
- Voice like Antoni didn't pronounce Igbo words correctly
- Understanding how to test different voices and find the best tone
- Adjusting pronunciation with commas and pauses for tonal accuracy
- Setting up Google Colab to manage files and run the app smoothly

## How I Overcame It
- Switched to the "Eze" voice ID for better Igbo tone
- Broke Igbo words into syllables where needed
- Added UI features like emojis, dropdowns, and download buttons to improve user experience
- Got step-by-step help uploading everything to GitHub for final submission
